# this file turns off TLS for the server. 
# Theoretically, the effect of using this file
# as an override for `compose.yaml` (production config)
# should be the same as using `compose-demo.yaml`,
# but I'm making this file to guarantee I'm testing 
# the production config with as little difference as possible 
# from the original, isolating TLS.
