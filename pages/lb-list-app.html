    <p>
        Letterboxd now requires a JavaScript engine to access any site data, and this is almost certainly to limit bot traffic. I respect that, so this utility has been <b>discontinued until further notice</b>.

    <!-- <p>Here you can take the URL from Letterboxd and convert it into a 
        <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/348960/what-is-a-csv-file-and-how-do-i-open-it/">CSV file.</a>
        CSV files are very versitile; a lot of different applications can open and use them,
        including Excel.

        <summary>Downloading a list you made?</summary>
        If you want to download lists you've made yourself, <b>and only want the title and year</b> information,
        your best option is using Letterboxd itself, actually. To download your own lists (bundled with all
        the rest of your Letterboxd activity), find your account on Letterboxd, then navigate to 
        <b>Settings</b> > <b>Data</b>, and click <b>Export</b>. That will give you a compressed file of 
        all your Letterboxd activity.

    <p>If you'd like to run this utility locally, check out this CLI version I made 
        <a href="https://github.com/lmr97/letterboxd_get_list">on GitHub</a>!
