# Archie: A Self-hosting Project

I had an old HP ProBook 640 laying around, and wanted to give it new life as a web server. I got a free domain from [noip.com](https://www.noip.com/), and went from there!

I wrote a custom back-end in Rust, designed to be make adding more functionality easier, as well as a small webpage for it to serve. The server runs on Arch Linux (appropriate for small projects like this).
